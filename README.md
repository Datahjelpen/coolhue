# Datahjelpen / brand / colors
List of all our colors. Including gradients.
Forked coolHue to make this. The gradients palette is **rendered by JavaScript Object** which makes it very easy to make a subtle update anytime.

# Installation
1. Download the latest version from the repository's release section.
2. Unpack the archive and drag `index.html` in the browser, to check out the default gradient palette.
3. All the gradients which are visible in the browser by default are rendered by `colorData` Javascript Object.
4. You just need to update the `colorData` Object (array) to create your very own gradient palette. So, Open `index.html` in the text editor and update the color codes.
5. Voila! :clap: drag the `index.html` into the browser and you are done!
